Hi! I'm Kristijan


Iâ€™m passionate about playing chess, along with other interests like playing football, learning the guitar, andâ€”last but certainly not leastâ€”programming. What started as a hobby has evolved into a lasting passion. 
My primary tech stack includes Java (Spring Boot), deploying and managing cloud infrastructure, and just enough front-end skills to confidently center a div ðŸ˜„.


Feel free to explore my projectsâ€”your feedback is always welcome!
