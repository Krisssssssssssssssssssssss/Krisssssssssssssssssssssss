<h2>Fullstack Development and DevOps Engeneering</h2>

Hi! I'm Kristijan


I’m passionate about playing chess, along with other interests like playing football, learning the guitar, and—last but certainly not least—programming. What started as a hobby has evolved into a lasting passion. 
<br>
My primary tech stack includes Java (Spring Boot), deploying and managing cloud infrastructure, and enough front-end skills to confidently center a div. 😄


Feel free to explore my projects—your feedback is always welcome!
